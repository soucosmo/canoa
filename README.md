# Canoa


### Introduction
A lightweight and powerful container orchestrator alternative to Kubernetes and Nomad with a focus on low resource consumption


### Attention
This project does not aim to compete with existing solutions such as Kubernetes and Nomad in container orchestration.

Its construction aims to be usable in Rust and GO microservices due to the low amount of resource consumption.

Development is active and sudden changes may occur at the beginning of development and until stability is achieved. Use at your own risk.

### Contributing
When making contributions, keep in mind that all development is aimed at low resource consumption and minimal external dependencies. Contributions containing third-party crates with less than 2 contributors will not be accepted. It is important to have active maintainers.
